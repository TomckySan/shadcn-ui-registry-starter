## Open in v0

[![Open in v0](https://shadcn-ui-registry-starter-gray.vercel.app/open-in-v0.svg)](https://v0.dev/chat/api/open?title=Dashboard+Kit&prompt=These+are+existing+design+system+styles+and+files.+Please+utilize+them+alongside+base+components+to+build.&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshadcn-ui-registry-starter-gray.vercel.app%2Fr%2Fdashboard.json)

This registry application also exposes `Open in v0` buttons for each component. Once this application is deployed, the
`Open in v0` button redirects to [`v0.dev`](https://v0.dev) with a prepopulated prompt and a URL pointing back to this
registry's `/r/${component_name}.json` endpoint. This endpoint will provide v0 the necessary file information, content,
and metadata to start your v0 chat with your component, theme, and other related code.

These `/r/${component_name}.json` files are generated using `shadcn/ui` during the `build` and `dev` based on the
repository's [`registry.json`](./registry.json). For more information, refer to the
[documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/registry-json).

## Running locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
